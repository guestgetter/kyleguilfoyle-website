<p>Brick by written brick.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That’s how Seth Godin built <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31750503-what-does-it-sound-like-when-you-change-your-mind">this book</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Since January 15th, 2002, Seth has written one blog post every day.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He’s admitted that not every post is a homerun (and that’s okay).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>His first post is what you'd expect to see in someone's diary. He wrote about how boring his experience was at the mall.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But over 2 decades, he’s curated many of the posts and turned them into published books like this one.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Some are even bestsellers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On my bookshelf, this book takes 'center stage'&nbsp;to remind me that daily writing can turn into a masterpiece.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And I assert that it’s in the very act of writing that&nbsp;ideas come to bear.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Most people think it’s already in their head. But&nbsp;it’s actually under the surface.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Words are like seeds you plant.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And as you write, ideas get nurtured, they grow, and finally bloom.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Once they’ve bloomed you can turn them into anything you want…</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>👉 A book…</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>👉 A movie…</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>👉 A speech...</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>👉 A podcast…</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>👉 A newsletter…</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>👉 A screenplay…</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>👉 A YouTube series…</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>👉 A little desktop daily calendar…</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>(You get the idea)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the point is words have power. And most of us take that for granted.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>GoodReads.com gets 120 million viewers every month. The average visit duration is over 4 minutes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That is not normal.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>People are hungry for insights, stories, tools, entertainment -- all&nbsp;stem from words.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I’m beginning to collect some of my writing here on this blog.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And if you’d like to build your platform -- brick by written brick -- but aren’t sure where to start, send me a DM.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I’d be happy to help.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As Mr. Keating says in the Dead Poets Society, “You must strive to find your own voice. Because the longer you wait to begin, the less likely you are to find it at all.”</p>

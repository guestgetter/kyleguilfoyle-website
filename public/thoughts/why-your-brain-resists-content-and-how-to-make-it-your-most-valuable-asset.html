            <!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For years, I thought my biggest struggle with publishing content was <strong>consistency</strong>. Or <strong>clarity</strong>. Or just feeling like it took forever to do.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And when I was consistent, I inevitably hit a point where I felt like I was just checking off a box:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“There you go, business—I made some cOnTenT.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Also—In the middle of the night a voice woke me up CONSTANTLY saying,</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I’m so embarassed.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>(This still happens, albeit less often)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eventually I would just stop producing content.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It didn’t add up.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>WTF is that?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Turns out, our brains are wired to treat publishing like stepping into a <strong>firing squad</strong>—pain, rejection, and uncertainty.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The truth? No one’s waiting to tear you down. They’re too busy worrying about their own lives.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Meanwhile, you keep yourself silent—for an audience that isn’t even watching.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And here’s the kicker—the very thing my brain was <em>screaming</em> in resistance to is what <strong>builds the most leverage over time</strong>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What follows are 6 mental reframes that turned content from a grind into <strong>a machine that builds leverage while I sleep.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":1068,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="http://kyleguilfoyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Content-Is-Leverage-Not-Lavour-1-1024x738.png" alt="Content Is Leverage Not Labour" class="wp-image-1068"/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">1) CONTENT IS LEVERAGE (NOT LABOUR)</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>You don’t publish content to be a “consistent” automoton. You publish to create leverage over your time.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The more you publish today, the more your future self will be rewarded.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">2) CONTENT BUILDS YOUR UNIQUE WORLD</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That to me is one of the coolest things—words, videos, media etc, build a “world” that others can spend time in.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The more there is for them to explore, the longer they’ll stay.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">3) CONTENT IS GRAVITY</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With every piece I publish, I strengthen the gravitational pull of my “world”.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And every piece published is a new mass in your world’s orbit—making it richer so that the pull is stronger, which brings more folks in and keeps them there longer.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The stronger your pull, the less you have to chase. Eventually, everything—clients, opportunities, impact—fall into your orbit.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">4) CONTENT IS ART</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Each piece is an asset that you pull out of your mind—and carve into its best expression. Just like a beautiful, timeless recording is crafted, you can do the same with your ideas, and store them into content.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">5) CONTENT IS MEDITATION</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Naval Ravikant says that the best time of his day is the first hour where he meditates. He just sits there with himself. Content is an opportunity to do the same. We can write to excavate, clarify, and sharpen our thinking.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Think about your thinking”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">6) CONTENT IS AN “INFINITE YOU”</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Content can potentially form millions of relationships with others in your sleep. These are called para-social bonds (basically, people form relationships with you, at sclae) and the more of these you have, the more you’ll grow.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:separator -->
<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>
<!-- /wp:separator -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So there it is. 6 reframes I drum into my programming until content becomes a process of joy, flow, and leverage.</p>

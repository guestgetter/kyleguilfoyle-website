# üö® URGENT SEO FIXES APPLIED - JULY 14, 2025

## **CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED**

After a comprehensive audit of your kyleguilfoyle.com website, I found **several critical SEO issues** that are almost certainly causing your Google indexing problems:

### **1. CANONICAL URL vs OPEN GRAPH URL INCONSISTENCY (CRITICAL)**
**Problem**: Your pages were sending mixed signals to Google about which URLs are "canonical"

**Before (BROKEN):**
- About page: Canonical = `/about` | Open Graph = `/about.html` | Sitemap = `/about`
- Contact page: Canonical = `/contact` | Open Graph = `/contact.html` | Sitemap = `/contact`  
- Thoughts page: Canonical = `/thoughts` | Open Graph = `/thoughts.html` | Sitemap = `/thoughts`

**After (FIXED ‚úÖ):**
- About page: Canonical = `/about` | Open Graph = `/about` | Sitemap = `/about`
- Contact page: Canonical = `/contact` | Open Graph = `/contact` | Sitemap = `/contact`
- Thoughts page: Canonical = `/thoughts` | Open Graph = `/thoughts` | Sitemap = `/thoughts`

### **2. DUPLICATE CONTENT ISSUES (CRITICAL)**
**Problem**: Multiple URLs serving the same content
- Both `/about` and `/about.html` were accessible (200 OK)
- Both `/contact` and `/contact.html` were accessible (200 OK)
- Both `/thoughts` and `/thoughts.html` were accessible (200 OK)

**Solution Applied**: Created `.htaccess` redirects to canonicalize URLs

### **3. INTERNAL LINKING INCONSISTENCIES**
**Problem**: Mixed internal linking patterns throughout your site
- Some pages linked to `/about` (clean)
- Other pages linked to `/contact.html` (with extension)
- Inconsistent patterns across the site

**Solution**: `.htaccess` now handles all redirects properly

### **4. SPAM ATTACK AFTERMATH**
**Problem**: Residual effects from the spam attack are still affecting site authority
**Solution**: Enhanced spam URL blocking with 410 Gone responses

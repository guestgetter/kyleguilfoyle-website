<p>Hey! Kyle here. Happy Xmas Eve.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The following has been on repeat in my brain for the last 2 weeks:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:quote -->
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong>"</strong>Life doesn't respond to your need.</p><p>You can't go to the soil and say, "I need a crop." The soil just smiles at you.</p><p>The soil says, "Don't bring me your need, bring me some seed. Bring me some effort, bring me some discipline, bring me some interest, bring me some service.</p><p>Bring me these things, and I'll return to you multiplied by two times, five times, ten times."</p><cite>Jim Rohn</cite></blockquote>
<!-- /wp:quote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So far, the best way I’ve discovered to ‘plant seeds’ is through&nbsp;<strong>content</strong>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When content is useful and generous -- it cultivates and nurtures relationships.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Each piece is like a handshake and an invitation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But content isn’t easy. Like anything that benefits from compounding, the magic happens beneath the surface. You can’t see results right away.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>(As a result, most people can't create content consistently, if at all.)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So the question I ask is:&nbsp;<strong>How can each piece of content pack maximum impact (for the healthiest harvest)?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here are 7 content 'filters' I've collected to ensure max impact: </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>1. Transformation</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One of my favourite book titles of all time is Seth Godin’s&nbsp;<em>What Does It Sound Like When You Change Your Mind?</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s a big-ass book. Here’s a shot of it with Vito’s head for scale:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"align":"left","id":584,"width":421,"height":561,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignleft size-large is-resized"><img src="http://kyleguilfoyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/IMG_3892-768x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-584" width="421" height="561"/></figure></div>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Every piece of content seeks to make a change in the reader.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the potential impact is no small potatoes: <strong>Nothing can free or imprison you more than a new belief.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For example, I remember the first time I read Tim Ferriss’ <em>4 Hour Work Week</em> in 2015. It was the first time I felt I could author my life the way I wanted to.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here I am 6 years later and I haven’t had a boss or employer in almost 2 years.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>That’s</em> transformation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But you don’t need to go write a book for that. You can do it brick by brick, seed by seed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Simple filter: My goal is to take the reader from X to Y.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>2. Point Of View</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Content must offer a point of view the reader can sink their teeth into.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>They can agree or disagree.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is how conversations are stirred and moved forward.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Simple filter: “Most people think / say / do X. Here’s why I believe that’s flawed / inaccurate / there’s a better way.”</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>3. Novelty</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It's no secret that people are attracted to 'new.'&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>New information releases dopamine. It gives an opportunity to share, connect, improve life, and ultimately move the species forward.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Simple filter: What am I saying that hasn't been said before? Am I creating something new, or regurgitating what's been well said elsewhere?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>4. Lived Experience</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Most people don’t realize their experiences are chock-full of lessons and insights.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Or they do, but don’t want to be ‘known’ for what they’ve done in the past.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>(This is ego.)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So they go out and find content around stuff they find interesting. But they end up parroting someone else and the content lands flat.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For example, I’ve been resistant to write about bartending.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>(Truth be told, if I worked one more shift behind a bar I’d probably have an aneurysm. Even my own bar!)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But it’s an existing body of knowledge that I can add meaningfully to. I’ve put in the time. I’ve mastered the craft.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And if you can add to a body of knowledge, you should do it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Simple filter: Here’s what I did. This is what I learned.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you’d like to create content in an area you’re trying to build expertise in, then...</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>5. Learn Out Loud + Experiment</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A fast way to get ‘lived experience’ is to pour yourself into learning something new. Along the way, expound on your ‘aha’ moments. And run experiments.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For example, the first thing I sold online was our <a href="https://nimblebar.co/bartending-school/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bartender training program</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>(To be fair, the first purchase was made online, but I ‘drove traffic’ from behind the bar 😆)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To make our training program look like a ‘thing,’ I poured myself into copywriting, offer creation, and landing pages.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I then wrote about <a href="https://copywritingcourse.com/increase-revenue-bars-restaurants/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the process in detail</a> on the Copywriting Course blog.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And don’t forget to share your resources: podcasts, articles, videos, books, tools, etc.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Simple devices:&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>Here’s something new I’m learning as I aim to accomplish X.</strong></li><li><strong>Here’s an experiment I ran. My hypothesis was X. Here’s what I learned. (👋🏼 What’s up, high school science?)</strong></li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>6. Can Be Actioned / Used</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The internet is valuable because it either provides a) escape, or b) utility.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Netflix = Escape.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Business YouTube channel = Utility.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Unfortunately, the internet is mostly a bloodsucker because it presents a third option, C: Fluff.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Fluffy content leads the reader to not know what they’re getting — ultimately feeling their time has been wasted.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So ask yourself, “How, specifically, can this piece of content be used / shared / actioned?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For example, this specific newsletter is a series of filters through which any writer I hire can put content through.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It saves time and leads to better results.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Simple device: How will this content provide either escape or utility?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>7. Stacks</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Finally, let’s come full circle to Seth Godin.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He is a master at ‘stacking’ content. He’s written a blog post every day for almost two decades.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Every post is like a brick that he lays -- stacking to build not only his body of knowledge, but that of the marketing community’s.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Many of those posts end up in his books, courses, and talks.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To get a sense of this, read his <a href="https://seths.blog/2002/01/boring_i_was_st/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">earliest</a> and <a href="https://seths.blog/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">most recent</a> posts.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>See how they’re like building blocks?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Simple filter: What is this building on top of? What can be built on top of it?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":580,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} -->

<p>Now go have some fun with your family :)</p>
